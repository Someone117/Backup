# Backup
A simple Android project to automatically back up files from your phone to a local SSH server. Only activates backup at a specific time and when connected to the correct Wi-Fi network.

To configure, simply change all the values marked by the ToDo comments, and then download to your device.

NOTE: You do have to manually set permissions for the app. The app requires location access all the time to function. :ocation access allows the app to get the SSID of the current Wi-Fi network, which is how the app knows what Wi-Fi network your phone is connected to.
